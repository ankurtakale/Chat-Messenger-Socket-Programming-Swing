# Chat-Messenger-Socket-Programming-Swing
Java GUI-Based Client–Server Chat Application (Socket Programming + Swing) Developed a two-way real-time chat application using Java Socket Programming and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Java Swing. The system consists of a dedicated server module and a client module, enabling text-based communication over a TCP connection.


Key Features:

1. TCP-based communication using ServerSocket, Socket, PrintStream, and BufferedReader.

2. Interactive GUI created with Swing components (JFrame, JButton, JTextArea, JTextField).

3. Bi-directional messaging between client and server in real time.

4. Event-driven architecture using Java’s ActionListener to handle user input.

5. Clean separation of logic:

 - GUIServer handles server initialization and message broadcasting.

 - GUIClient manages client connection and message exchange UI.

6. Designed to run on localhost (port 5100) for testing local communication.


Tech Stack :

1. Java

2. Java Swing

3. Java Networking (Sockets)

4. TCP/IP Protocol
